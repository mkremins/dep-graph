dep-graph
========================================

A simple dependency graph datastructure for Clojure and ClojureScript.

This code was originally written by Stuart Sierra for [tools.namespace](https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace). I've merely extracted it from that library and made it usable from CLJS.

Usage
----------------------------------------

Add to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
[mkremins/dep-graph "0.1.0"]
```
